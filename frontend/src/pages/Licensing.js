                1. Driver's License Requirements:
              </h3>
              <p className="pb-5 pl-2.5">
                To rent a car from CarGo, you must possess a valid driver's
                license. We accept licenses issued by recognized authorities in
                your country of residence or a valid international driving
                permit (IDP) if required. It is essential to ensure that your
                license is current and not expired.

              </h3>
              <p className="pb-5 pl-2.5">
                The minimum age to rent a car varies depending on the location
                and the type of vehicle. In most cases, the minimum age is 21
                years old. However, for certain car categories or specific
                regions, the minimum age may be higher, typically 25 years old,
                due to insurance restrictions. Please review the age
                requirements during the reservation process.
              </p>

              <p className="pb-5 pl-2.5">
                If someone other than the primary renter will be driving the
                vehicle, their details must be provided during the reservation
                process. Additional drivers are required to meet the same
                licensing requirements as the primary renter and may be subject
                to additional driver fees.

              <p className="pb-5 pl-2.5">
                CarGo welcomes international visitors, and in most cases, you
                can use your foreign driver's license to rent a car. However, it
                is advisable to carry an international driving permit (IDP) as
                an additional form of identification and translation of your
                license. Please check the specific requirements of the country
                you will be renting the car in.

              </h3>
              <p className="pb-5 pl-2.5">
                During the rental process, we may verify the validity and
                authenticity of your driver's license to ensure compliance with
                legal regulations and maintain the safety of our customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is important to familiarize yourself with the licensing
                requirements applicable to your specific location and ensure
                that you meet all necessary criteria. Failure to comply with
                licensing policies may result in denial of rental services. If
                you have any further questions or need assistance regarding
                licensing, please do not hesitate to contact our dedicated
                customer service team.
